        <h1>BicBucStriim</h1>
        <p>BicBucStriim streams books, digital books. It fills a gap in the functionality of current NAS devices, which provide access to your collection of music, videos and photos -- but not books. BicBucStriim covers that area and provides web-based access to your e-book collection.</p>

      <h1>BicBucStriim</h1>

<p>BicBucStriim was created when I bought a NAS device (Synology DS 512+) to store my media on it. NAS devices like the Synology DS typically include media servers that publish audio, video, photos, so that you can access your media from all kinds of devices (TV, smart phone, laptop ...) inside the house, which I found very convenient. Unfortunately there was nothing like that for e-books. So I started to develop BicBucStriim.</p>

<p>BicBucStriim is a simple PHP application that runs in the Apache/PHP environment provided by the NAS (or any other server). It assumes that you manage your e-book collection with <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>. The application reads the Calibre data and publishes it in HTML form. To access the e-book catalog you simply point your ebook reader to your NAS, select one of your e-books and download it. </p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>BicBucStriim is intended for in-house usage, on a NAS or a similar device without much memory and processing power. On a PC you could simply use the Content Server built into Calibre.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a possibility to publish a larger book collection, or want to publish on the Internet, then <a href="http://calibre2opds.com/">calibre2opds</a> might be interesting. It generates a static HTML catalog of a Calibre library that then can be transferred to a web server.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

</ul>


<h2>Features</h2>

<p>BicBucStriim just displays what is stored in your Calibre library. The start page lists the 30 most recent books in your library, assuming that they are new and therefore need to be read:</p>

<p><img src="img/bbs-080a-index-en.png" alt="The index lists the 30 most recent books."/></p>

<p>In addition the main menu shows three ways to navigate through your library, by book title (<em>books</em>), author name (<em>authors</em>) and tag (<em>tags</em>). All three sections work in the same way, you either scroll through the listing or filter/search by entering something in the search bar at the top.</p>

<p><img src="img/bbs-080a-listing-en.png" alt="Navigating through your library by book title"/></p>

<p>Once a book is selected, the app shows a details page with title, author information, tags and the book description. In the download section of that page there are download links for all book formats stored in the Calibre library. Click on a link and the book file will be immediately sent to your device.</p>

<p><img src="img/bbs-080a-title-en.png" alt="A detail page"/></p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>The easy way assumes that BicBucStriim lives right below the web root of your device and can be addressed like <code>http://&lt;your ip&gt;/bbs/</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Download a installation archive from <a href="https://github.com/rvolz/BicBucStriim/downloads">GitHub</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unarchive the downloaded archive below the web server root of your NAS (e.g. "/volume1/web" on a Synology device)
  </li>
  <li>
    Rename the newly created directory (e.g. BicBucStriim-0.7.0) to "bbs".
  </li>
  <li>
    The "data" directory and its contents must be writeable for all. Depending on your method of unarchiving this might be already the case. However, in case you experience access error just use a terminal to correct this: `chmod -R ga+w data`.
  </li>
  <li>
    A freshly installed BicBucStriim app will show you the admin section, where you will have tell the app where your Calibre library is located. Everything else is optional. Just have a look ang navigate to: `http://&lt;address of your NAS&gt;/bbs/`.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      On some NAS devices, like Synology, you also have to add the path of your Calibre library to the PHP <em>open_basedir</em> variable, if the library is located outside the web folder. For security reasons PHP can only access files in the web folder and in directories mentioned in the <em>open_basedir</em> variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a Synology device you can set this in the <em>Control Panel</em>: navigate to 'Web Services', 'PHP Settings'. Add your Calibre library path to the end of <em>open_basedir</em> (and don't forget to separate it with a colon -- ':' -- from the other directories).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Tell BicBucStriim where your Calibre library lives</h3>

<p><img src="img/bbs-080-admin-en.png" alt="Everthing can be configured in the admin section"/></p>

<p>BicBucStriim needs to know where you Calibre library directory resides, the full path to the folder that contains your metadata.db and the book directories. In my case that is <code>/volume1/books</code> so I entered this path in the admin page.</p>

<p>That is all you need to do to get BicBucStriim running. Save and navigate to the start page. The index page should appear.</p> 

<p>If the app can't access the Calibre library it will tell you. BicBucStriim looks for a valid Calibre libraray directory with file `metadata.db` at the top. The most common problems are access errors. The app must be able to access the library. In case of problems you should adjust your access restrictions for the Calibre directory.</p>

<h3>Optional: Protect the admin section</h3>

<p>If you are sharing your home network with others you might want to restrict access to BicBucStriims admin page so that nobody can change the settings/passwords. To do this simply enter an admin password and save again. From then on the admin page is only accessible for people with the right password.</p>

<h3>Optional: Download protection</h3>

<p>BicBucStriim is a personal application and assumes that it is running in a safe environment. The emphasis is on conveniency in your home LAN, so there is not much security built in. However, for situations where <em>parental control</em>, or something like that, is necessary, we have the download protection. When activated users need a password to download book files. By default downloads are not protected.</p>

<p>By default the download protection is switched off. If you want to enable it you have two options:</p> 

<ol>
  <li>
    Reuse the admin password: if you already have an admin password and won't have to share it just click on this option. Book downloads will be protected using your admin password. You don't need to have two passwords in this case.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the above scenario doesn't fit, you can simply use a separate password for download.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That's it. (To turn download protection off just click the <em>No</em> option.) The download links will now only appear if the valid password was entered:</p>

<p><img src="img/bbs-070-dlprot-en.png" alt="Download protection in action"/></p>

<h3>Optional: Change the look of thumbnails</h3>

<p>
  By default BicBucStriim generates <em>clipped</em> thumbnails for books. That means it uses the largest possible square in the middle of the book cover. That way we get a small thummbnail that still shows enough details from the original cover image.
</p>
<p>
  However, if you absoloutely need to see a true representation of the cover image, just set the switch <em>Clip thumbnails?</em> to <em>No</em>, and you will get it.
</p>

<h2 id="opds">OPDS catalogs</h2>

<p>
  Starting with version 0.9 BicBucStriim provides OPDS catalogs for reading apps like Stanza or Aldiko. The main entry point for these catalogs is <code>http://.../bbs/opds/</code>.
</p>
<p>
  At this stage the OPDS support provides the usual hierarchy for browsing your library by book title, author, tag or series. Searching is not yet possible.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: If the global download protection is activated it is currently not possible to download books via OPDS.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Apache web server with PHP 5.2+ and sqlite3 support</li>
<li>Optional: if mcrypt is available, it will be used to encrypt cookies</li>
</ul>
